# Python Game using Turtle Graphics
This is my Project (for school's evaluation).

## Description of the Project:
In this project, I have made a game on Python using Turtle Graphics. In this game, we need to choose the no of sticks from the left side, and then the computer would also choose the number of sticks and remove it (it will do the same from right).

The one, who removed the last stick wins.

## Requirements:
1. Python IDLE (any version).
2. Visual Studio Code by Microsoft (You can use any other IDLE too, but I recommend to use this one)

## Some glimpses of the project:
